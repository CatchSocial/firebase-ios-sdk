# Remote Config Console API

[`RemoteConfigConsole.swift`](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/master/FirebaseRemoteConfig/Tests/SwiftAPI/RemoteConfigConsole.swift)
provides a simple API for interacting with an app's remote config on the
Firebase console.

## Local Development Setup
1. Create a Firebase project on the Firebase Console and download
the  `GoogleService-Info.plist`.
2. Navigate to your project's settings. Click on the **Service accounts** tab and
then download a private key by clicking the blue button that says "Generate new private key".
Rename it `ServiceAccount.json`.
3. Within the `firebase-ios-sdk`, run:
```bash
./scripts/generate_access_token.sh local_dev PATH/TO/ServiceAccount.json FirebaseRemoteConfig/Tests/SwiftAPI/AccessToken.json
```
4. Generate the `FirebaseRemoteConfig` project:
```bash
pod gen FirebaseRemoteConfig.podspec --local-sources=./ --auto-open --platforms=ios
```
5. Copy the `GoogleService-Info.plist` you downloaded earlier into the generated
Xcode project.

ðŸš€ Everything is ready to go! Run the tests in the `swift-api-tests` target.


## How it works

While the `RemoteConfigConsole` API basically just makes simple network calls,
we need to include an `access token` so our requests do the proper "handshake" with the Firebase console.

### Firebase Service Account Private Key
This private key is needed to create an access token with the valid parameters
that authorizes our requests to programmatically make changes to remote config on the Firebase console.

The private key can be located on the Firebase console and navigate to your project's settings. Click on
the **Service accounts** tab and and then generate the private key by clicking
the blue button that says "Generate new private key".

A `.json` file will be downloaded. Go ahead and rename this file
to `ServiceAccount.json` and move it to your `$HOME/.credentials/` directory.
You may have to create the `$HOME/.credentials/` directory.

### Create the Access Token
We use Google's [Auth Library for Swift](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-swift)
to generate the access token. There are a few example use cases provided. We use the [`TokenSource`](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-swift/blob/master/Sources/Examples/TokenSource/main.swift)
example.

In the local development and GHA scripts, the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
env variable is set to the path of the `ServiceAccount.json` file we setup earlier.

### Remote Config API Tests
There is a [section](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/master/FirebaseRemoteConfig/Tests/SwiftAPI/APITests.swift#L195)
of tests in [`APITests.swift`](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/master/FirebaseRemoteConfig/Tests/SwiftAPI/APITests.swift)
showcasing the  `RemoteConfigConsole` in action.
